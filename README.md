# Open-Celtx

## Script Writing and Production Suite

The following was previously recommended in the README but currently I am not sure which
ones are still valid. "It compiles for me" :-)

```
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade
apt-get install build-essential libasound2-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libnotify-dev \
	libxt-dev libiw-dev mesa-common-dev autoconf2.13 yasm libidl-dev \
	libfreetype6-dev zlib1g-dev libgtk2.0-dev libdbus-glib-1-dev libpangox-1.0-dev
```

### Not sure if this is necessary
```apt-get build-dep firefox-esr```

Type make to build on my amd64 Buster release  debian Linux

When compiled run `objdir/dist/celtx/celtx` if happy install with make install

This Makefile has clunky extra compile flags to make it find everything which are
not necessary in my debian packaged version..
My debhelper rules is much simpler :
```
    export DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS = hardening=-fortify,-stackprotector,-format,-stackprotectorstrong
    export DEB_CXXFLAGS_APPEND  = -Wno-error=narrowing
```
